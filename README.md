## Functions
SBCs commonly maintain full session state and offer the following functions:

### Connectivity & Compatibility
Allow multiple networks to communicate through the use of a variety of techniques such as:
* Advanced [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) Traversal Capabilities
* [SIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol) normalization, SIP message and header manipulation
* Call Party Translatation
* [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) connectivity
* Protocol translations between [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol), [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) & [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)
* Powerful built-in routing engine.
* Allowing control routing by 3rd-party software via [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
* Dynamic Load Balancing, Failover, Distribution

### Security:
Protect the network and other devices from:
* Malicious attacks such as a denial-of-service attack ([DoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)) or distributed DoS
* Toll fraud via rogue media streams
* SIP Malformed Packet Protection
* Topology hiding by back to back user agent ([B2BUA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-back_user_agent))
* Encryption of signaling (via TLS) and media ([SRTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Real-time_Transport_Protocol))
* Access Control List
* Auto Control Network Firewall
* SIP Firewall Level

### Quality of service 
The [QoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service) policy of a network and prioritization of flows is usually implemented by the SBC. It can include such functions as:
* Resource allocation
* [Rate limiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_volume_(telecommunications)) include call per second (cps), concurrent calls (concurency)
* Traffic Optimization by [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) and [leaky bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket)
* [ToS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_of_service)/[DSCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_services) bit setting

### Media services
Offer border-based media control and services such as:
* Media encoding/decoding ([SRTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Real-time_Transport_Protocol)/[RTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol))
* [DTMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling) relay and interworking include In-Band Signaling (touch tones), Out-of-Band Signaling ([RFC2833](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2833.txt)) and SIP INFO Method
* Media Codec transcoding: [G711A/U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.711), [G729](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.729), [OPUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_(audio_format)), [AMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_Multi-Rate_audio_codec), [G.722.2 AMR-WB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_Multi-Rate_Wideband)
* Tones and announcements (Early Media)
* Data and fax interworking
* Support multiple Media mode: Proxy, Bypass, Transcode
* Voice Activity Detection [VAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_activity_detection)
* Confort Noise Generation [CNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_noise)

### Intergration
Support to intergrate with 3rd-party system or customer function easily
* Flexible JSON for Call Detail Record ([CDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record)), Send CDR to HTTP API, enabling customized/3rd-party usage such as databases, data analysis or billing purpose. 
* Customization routing mechanism via HTTP API
* Network capture support: Live Capture and Intergrated with [Homer](https://sipcapture.org/) 
* [SNMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol) and/or [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) monitoring

### High Avaibility
* [Distributed System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing)
* Active-Active [Cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster) Concept
* Healthcheck and Failure Autodetection
